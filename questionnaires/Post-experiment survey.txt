Post-experiment survey

AI4TDD experiment
The goal of this experiment is to develop in Python the following features:
The class TextFormatter should have three functions.
The 7rst should be called setLineWidth and receive the length of the lines that should be returned by the
other functions.
The second function receives a single word and returns the word in the center.
The third function receives two words and returns the line with the words spread.
You are free to make assumptions regarding the details of the implementation.
To develop it, you will use Test Driven Development and, in particular, assertion 4rst.
This means that you incrementally develop a test method by test case, like
Step 1
import unittest
class Tester(unittest.TestCase):
def myTest(self):
self.assertEqual(ExpectedOutput1, classToCall.callToMethodUnderTest(Input1))
Step 2
import unittest
class Tester(unittest.TestCase):
def myTest(self):
classToCall = ClassToCall()
self.assertEqual(ExpectedOutput1, classToCall.callToMethodUnderTest(Input1))
Please report the measures below regarding your work.
You are also free to leave the experiment at any moment.
